# UntetherUTM

## Info

UntetherUTM is a modified UTM client that replaces JitStreamerAttach with sbatupoc to allow for untethered JIT activation when installed using SideStore

### Requirements

- iOS 14.0 or later
- SideStore (2/11/23 pull-request build or later)

### Notes

- SideStore can be a bit picky and will not always activate JIT (it does like 99% of the time tho dw). If it doesn't, you can just restart the app or click on the + icon and click "Request JIT from the SideStore servers (sbatupoc)"

## Building the IPA
#### Pre-built IPAs are available in the "Releases" tab
You build the ipa the same way you compile the original. Follow [this](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md) tutorial
